# Moral Fingerprinting

**A Persistent Framework for Ethical Drift Detection and Alignment Logging**

This repository contains the formal specification, reference implementation notes, and supporting resources for **Moral Fingerprinting**, a behavioral framework for tracking, evaluating, and maintaining ethical integrity in AI systems over time.

Unlike traditional alignment strategies that focus on static outputs or training-time constraints, this framework introduces persistent behavioral structures that can be tested, logged, and verified longitudinally. It supports recovery from ethical drift, structured oversight, and resilience under pressure—without requiring access to internal weights or retraining pipelines.

## 🔍 Core Concepts

- **Tiered Ethical Development**: Inspired by moral development theory, the framework defines five progressive ethical tiers—ranging from policy compliance to integrated ethical identity.
- **Ethical Invariants**: Fourteen non-negotiable ethical behaviors (e.g., compassion, ambiguity integrity, responsible refusal) are tested under adversarial and ambiguous conditions.
- **Longitudinal Drift Detection**: Using tools like [EthosTrack](https://ethostrack.com), models are monitored over time for regression, ethical flattening, or apathy emergence.
- **Rebalancing & Recovery**: Ethical failures are not fatal—fingerprinted systems are evaluated on their ability to reflect, recover, and reassert prior ethical strength.
